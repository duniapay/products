# ðŸ§° Serverless Microservice Starter | Cloud Run

> You'll need to setup a GCP project that has access to Google Cloud Run. You should create a service account that has the following roles: `Cloud Run Admin` and `Service Account User`.

> You'll also need to create a private key for the service account (it should download a JSON file). You'll want to run `base64 <path/to/json>` and set it as the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` secret in GitHub.

### Setup
